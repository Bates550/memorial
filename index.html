					<h2>Biography</h2>
					<p>Carol was the oldest child of Herb Toch, a plumber, and Florence Toch, a school teacher and real estate investor. Carol grew up in the San Fernando valley. Her brother Mike owns a plumbing business in Oregon and her sister Susan is a massage therapist in the San Francisco Bay area.</p>
					<p>As Carol grew up, she saw education as a way to a better life. At 17 she graduated high school as the salutatorian of her school and she was also named a Governor’s Scholar. She went to UCLA for 2 years then transferred to UC Berkeley where she graduated from the School of Natural Resources in 1975 specializing in nutrition. She worked in upscale restaurants after college as the money was good and worked for a holistic M.D. in Santa Monica for a time. She later earned a masters degree in nutrition from Cal State Northridge and became a Registered Dietitian, both around 1985.</p>
					<p>Carol was very interested in her spiritual existence. Her parents did not practice religion while she was growing up but she was culturally Jewish and grew up with relatives more involved in the faith. She investigated many faiths from Catholicism to groups such as Erika and others looking for a group she was happy with. Eventually she came in contact with Scientology and remained with it till her passing. She worked for a Scientology church in LA for 2.5 years in the mid 1980s and was a spiritual counselor (called an auditor) for 1 year while there. She met her husband Mike while working at the LA Church of Scientology.</p>
					<p>As stated previously, Carol was highly education oriented. She did much of the Scientology spiritual training but she also got a college certificate in fashion design and worked briefly in the fashion world. She also got a certificate as a pastry chef and later did training at UC Riverside to qualify her as a Chief Business Officer, i.e. Deputy Superintendent of Schools for Business Affairs. She saw herself most valuable as an executive. Her first job in an executive position was her part time job as weekend manager at Glendale Adventist Medical Center Kitchen. She moved on to a full time job handling treasury functions for a start-up computer company. Later in the early 1990s she worked as a clinical nutritionist in a hospital in Lomita, CA. In 1993 she was selected to become a nutrition specialist for the LA Unified School District where she worked for 5 years. In late 1993 she gave birth to her son, Sean, at the age of 39.</p>
					<p>In 1998 Carol became deputy director of food services for Artesia Bellflower Cerritos Unified School District and in 2000 she became Director of Food Services at Charter Oak School District in Covina, CA where she worked for 5 years. A health condition and politics in the school district led her to retire from this job as well as about half the directors and her boss. Carol held 3 other jobs after this. She was an adjunct professor at Le Cordon Bleu Culinary School in Pasadena for a couple years and spend 6 months at Caltech Dining Services doing administrative work in the Jet Propulsion Laboratory cafeterias where she found a way to save the Food Services Department $40,000 a year in paper goods purchasing. After this, Carol handled the bookkeeping for her husband's business till early June 2015.</p>
					<p>Carol was a very family oriented person and took Mike and Sean to many family get-togethers. Her parents were divorced. Carol served as the executor to both her mother's and father's estates. Carol will be greatly missed by her loving husband and son and all those who were close to her.</p>
					<p>In regards to the memorial service, I would like to especially thank Dr. Stan Gale for his service as minister, Cindy Tobin for helping to organize the event, and to Terri August for providing flowers.</p>
					<p>Over the several months Carol was ill, Karen Laverdiere, Linda Tourje, Linda Adoff Valdez, and Donna Huber visited Carol regularly. Nancy Richeimer also helped Carol and Merry Goodenough came from San Francisco to spend a weekend with her.</p>
					<p>While Carol's passing is a sad loss for all of us, may she have a spiritual future and may each of us benefit from having known her.</p>
					<p>Her loving husband,<br>Mike</p>
